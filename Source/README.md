# Pipes

## Description

An UE 5.3 project that aims to deliver a simple Pipes game. The player has a limited time to connect the pipes from the starting point to the end by turning the correct pipes before time runs out. Each level should be solvable, and with each win, the difficulty increases (shorter timer and longer route).
